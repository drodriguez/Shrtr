Shrtr
=====

Shrtr is a personal web service to short URLs and have a shorter link
that will redirect the user to the longer URL. Ideal for IM, IRC and
email. Do you know http://bit.ly ? Well, it's the same, but personal,
and without all the statistics.

Ideally it should be running in http://shr.tr, but Turkey do not allow
second-level registrations, so it will be never there.

Sinatra template based on http://github.com/raul/sinatra_template.

Shrtr is heavily inspired in
[Lessn](http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2009/08/17/less_n), but I
wanted to reimplement it using Sinatra and play along with Tokyo
Cabinet. If you want a completed service, maybe lessn is better for your
needs (Shrtr is complete, but rought in the edges).
